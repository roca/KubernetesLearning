 Hi Johnny

   It's been a while. Hope all is well. I'm looking for some expert advice in the AWS echo system.
   I've attend your classes in the past on this subject.

   While attending a meetup near my home I connected with someone pushing a interesting project.

   It's called splitEV (https://docsend.com/view/tcvxa9t5twe2vmae). I've decide to dive in and help.
   So far we have had three zoom meetings. At a high level the platform is as follows:

	•	Drivers: A mobile app that allows EV owners to locate and book charging stations in real-time, start/stop charging sessions, and handle payments.
	•	Hosts: A web-based dashboard for property owners to manage their charging stations, set pricing, track usage, and receive payouts.

   I'd like to be able to invite you on one of the zoom calls to get your opinion on building and scaling this platform. I know you keep a busy schedule, so I 
   won't take too much of your time. Hoping you'll like what you see.
